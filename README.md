# Twitter Search Engine

This project is a Twitter search engine that utilizes both MongoDB and PostgreSQL databases to store and retrieve tweets efficiently. It provides a user-friendly interface for searching tweets based on various criteria.

## Project Overview

The Twitter search engine project allows users to search for tweets based on keywords, user names, hashtags, and more. It offers two backend database options: MongoDB for non-relational storage and PostgreSQL for relational storage.

## Features

- **Search Functionality**: Users can search for tweets using keywords, user names, hashtags, etc.
- **Database Integration**: Utilizes MongoDB and PostgreSQL databases for efficient data storage and retrieval.
- **Dataset Preprocessing**: Data preprocessing tasks include formatting and storing data in both non-relational and relational databases.
- **Flask Web Application**: The project includes a Flask web application to provide a user interface for interacting with the search engine.
- **Database Indexing**: Optimizes database performance through indexing, enhancing search speed.
- **User-Defined Functions**: Incorporates custom functions for frontend operations to improve user experience.
- **Cache Management**: Implements cache management mechanisms for enhancing system performance.
